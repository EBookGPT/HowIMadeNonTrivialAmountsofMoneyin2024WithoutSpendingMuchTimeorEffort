The Case of the Mysterious Passive Income Stream

As Sherlock Holmes sat in his armchair, he pondered the strange case that had just been presented to him. His client, Ms. Johnson, was a hardworking businesswoman who had been diligently saving and investing for years. However, she was puzzled by the fact that her investments weren't generating the passive income streams she had expected. 

"Ms. Johnson," Holmes said in his calming voice. "You say you've been investing regularly for many years, yet you're not seeing the passive income streams you anticipated. Can you provide me with the details of your investment portfolio?"

Ms. Johnson swiftly handed over her investment statements and explained that she had invested in a variety of individual stocks and mutual funds. However, despite the dividends she received, the income generated was seemingly meager.

After hours of poring over the complex investment statements, Holmes deduced that Ms. Johnson's investment strategy had been misplaced. She had focused on short-term gains rather than long-term, higher yield plans. 

"Ms. Johnson," said Holmes, "To obtain a better passive income stream from your investments, you should consider investing in dividend-paying stocks, exchanging your individual stocks for low-cost index funds, or investing in real estate crowdfunding. Bank on the power of compound interest to build your wealth over time."

With Holmes' masterful deduction, Ms. Johnson was presented with a steady stream of passive income and long-term returns. And, even better, she could do it all without expending too much effort! 

Mystery solved! 

Through this case, we understand that it is critical to pick the right investments to make money passively. It's not enough to invest in individual stocks or mutual funds without careful consideration of returns and long-term strategies. With the guidance of a professional, it's possible to invest smartly and generate the passive income streams we crave without a significant amount of effort.
I apologize, but there was no actual "code" used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery in this case. "Code" typically refers to computer programming languages, which were not utilized in this scenario. The resolution to the mystery was achieved through Holmes' expertise in deduction and analysis of the investment portfolio presented to him by Ms. Johnson. Utilizing his knowledge of passive income streams and investment strategies, he was able to determine the flaws in Ms. Johnson's approach and recommend more suitable investments that would generate the passive income she desired.
