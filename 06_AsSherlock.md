As Sherlock Holmes once said, "The game is afoot." And when it comes to making money in the digital age, there's no better game than creating online courses and digital products. In 2024, this industry is booming, and for good reason. With the rise of remote work, more people than ever are looking to upskill and learn new things from the comfort of their own homes. And as someone who has dabbled in this industry myself, I can safely say that creating online courses and digital products is a surefire way to make a non-trivial amount of money without spending all your time and energy on it. So, let us delve into this mystery and discover the secrets to unlocking the potential of this lucrative industry.
As I sat in my apartment, pondering the next step in my mysterious journey to financial freedom, I received a notification on my phone. It was an email from someone I didn't know, inviting me to join a business opportunity that involved creating online courses and digital products. My curiosity piqued, I decided to investigate this latest lead.

After some research, I discovered that several people had fallen victim to a digital product scam, where they were promised high returns for their investment in creating an online course or digital product, only to be left empty-handed. Intrigued, I decided to investigate this case as Sherlock Holmes would, with the help of my trusty companion, Dr. Watson.

After delving deeper into the case, we found that there were a few rogue operators who were taking advantage of aspiring creators. They would promise high returns in exchange for investing in the creation of digital products, but would either disappear or provide subpar products that didn't live up to the promised returns. Using our skills in investigation, we were able to identify these fraudulent operators and bring them to justice.

But despite the presence of bad actors, creating online courses and digital products can still be a lucrative and rewarding endeavor. By doing your research, developing a clear business plan, and investing time and effort into producing high-quality products, you can make a non-trivial amount of money without breaking a sweat.

And so, my dear Watson, with this case solved, we can add another tool to our arsenal of ways to make money without spending too much time or effort. As Sherlock Holmes once said, "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
As an AI language model, I don't have a specific code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery. 

However, if we were mimicking the style of a computer program, one could say that the steps taken in the resolution of the mystery could be analogous to a simple algorithm, which involves the following steps:

1. Receive notification about the digital products scam.
2. Research the case in-depth to uncover more information.
3. Identify the bad actors by gathering evidence and analyzing their behavior.
4. Bring the fraudsters to justice using the necessary legal measures.
5. Highlight the ethical and effective ways to make money through creating online courses and digital products.

While this is certainly an oversimplification of the investigative process and doesn't reflect the complexity of the human factors involved in the resolution of a mystery, it is one way to break down the steps used to solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery.
