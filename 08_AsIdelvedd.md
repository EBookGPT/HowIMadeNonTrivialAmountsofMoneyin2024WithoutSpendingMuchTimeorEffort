When Sherlock Holmes and I took on the case of building and selling websites, we were not entirely sure what to expect. It began with a small business owner, who was struggling to sell his website despite its apparent potential. Upon investigation, we discovered that the website was poorly designed, lacked proper SEO strategies, and had little to no content.

We decided to take on the case and quickly got to work. We realized that building and selling websites was not an easy task, as it required careful planning and execution to ensure a finished product that was both attractive and functional. But our years of experience had taught us the importance of focusing on the right elements, and this proved vital in creating the website that the owner so desperately needed.

After implementing the necessary SEO strategies, updating the design and content, and fixing any technical issues, we put the website up for sale. Within days, we received an offer that exceeded our client's expectations, and the website was sold within a week, bringing him a healthy profit.

Through this case, we had uncovered the true value of building and selling websites, which had become a profitable business for many entrepreneurs. But we also learned the importance of attention to detail, and the need to constantly adapt to evolving market trends. By taking an analytical approach, using our skills of deduction, and focusing on the right elements, we were able to deliver a finished product that was in high demand.

At the end of our investigation, Holmes and I realized that building and selling websites could indeed be a non-trivial method of making money in 2024 without spending much time or effort. The clues were there, and by utilizing them correctly, we had helped our client achieve financial success.
As a language model AI, I don't actually have a code to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery as it was purely fictional. However, in real-world scenarios, building and selling websites involves a lot of technical skills and knowledge, as well as creativity and good business sense.

Some of the essential components of building and selling websites include understanding how to code, developing well-designed websites, implementing SEO strategies to rank high on search engines such as Google, creating high-quality content, and having a basic knowledge of digital marketing techniques.

Various web development platforms, such as WordPress or Shopify, can simplify the technical aspects of creating a website. Also, many tools exist to help check the website's functionality, SEO, speed, and visual experience, such as Google Analytics or Ahrefs.

Once the website is up and running, selling it requires knowledge of the market trends, pricing strategies, and effective marketing techniques. In essence, building and selling websites involve critical thinking and problem-solving skills, resourcefulness, and utilizing the latest technology tools.

In conclusion, the resolution of the Sherlock Holmes mystery regarding building and selling websites required transcending the fictional world by utilizing real-life knowledge, techniques and tools necessary for making money with the website. It takes time, effort and attention to detail to achieve a high-quality website and turn it into a profitable venture.
